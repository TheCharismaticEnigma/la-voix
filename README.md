# La Voix (The Voice) 


`This is a DESKTOP clone of the Spotify Web App which was specifically made NON-RESPONSIVE with the intention of showcasing all the features.`

`Meticulously created using the official Spotify Web Api and official Software Development Kits`, this app provides all the major features like 
authorization with OAuth2.0, dynamically rendering the related artists, related albums, the search query results according to different tags, etc. 

With the aid of Spotify Typescript SDK, the app is programmed using React and Typescript and Firebase was used as a deployment solution. 

`NOTE - Due to the unanswered request, currently the app authorizes only the users who were specified in the developer dashboard. `
 `Attributable to SPOTIFY RESTRICTIONS, the web player couldn't be implemented and only previews can be listened to. `
